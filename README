# Evaluation script for SISAP 23 LAION2B Challenge 

This repository contains tools to evaluate implementations participating in the [SISAP 2023 LAION2B Challenge](https://sisap-challenges.github.io/).

## Adding into your repository

Run `git submodule add https://github.com/sisap-challenges/sisap23-laion-challenge-evaluation eval` in your repository.
Make sure to check out submodules in GHA as well. This can be achieved by adding
```
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          submodules: 'true'
```
to your steps.

## Expected file format

Results are stored in an hdf5 file (suffix `.h5`) in `results`.

The following attributes should be present in the [hdf5 attributes](https://docs.h5py.org/en/stable/high/attr.html).

- **data**: hamming, pca32, pca96
- **size**: "100K", "1M", "10M", "100M" 
- **algo**: easily identifiable string for your implementation, e.g., "faissIVF"
- **buildtime**: time in seconds needed to build the index
- **querytime**: time in seconds needed to answer all queries
- **params**: hyperparameter description

Two groups **knns** for identifiers and **dists** for distances.

## Evaluation

Run 

```python

python3 eval/eval.py
```

in your base repository. This produces a csv file `res.csv` that can be used for further processing.
